Repository for COMP3123

My name is Veronyque Lemieux (but please call me Vero) and I am a third year Computer Programmer Analyst student at George Brown College. Over the summer, I had the opportunity to intern as a technical developer at The Jonah Group, a software consultant firm in Downtown Toronto. I am now currently working part-time as one of their website administrators. I am looking forward to learning full stack development with Mike!
